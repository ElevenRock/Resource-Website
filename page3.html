            <li>Put the soaked paper into a blender.</li>
            <li>If the blender isn't as strong, use less paper.</li>
            <li>If the pulp doesn't have any hard pieces that you can feel, it's done. If not, blend some more.</li>
        </ol>
        

     

        <p class="margin"> If you want to use it later, you can partly strain it.</p>
        <p class="margin">  Donâ€™t strain it completely as it can make it lumpy. Keep it slightly wet.</p> 
        <br>
        <p class="margin"> 
            Reuse the water you used to strain the previous paper pulp into the blender again and top it off with new water if necessary so you can use the least amount of water. You should only see small pieces. If you see large chunks keep on stirring. </p>
        <br>
        <p class="margin"> Next Step: Move the frames around so the pulp spreads evenly while the water is straining out. </p>

            When it's ready to be transferred </p>

            <ol class="margin">
                <li>Lay out your cloth sheets.</li>
                <li>Flip your mold over the cloth sheet.</li>
                <li>Press it in firmly on all sides then use your sponge to soak up excess water.</li>
                <li>Squeeze the water right back into the container.</li>
                <li>Carefully stack each sheet on top of each other.</li>
                <li>It's okay to mess up; it's often very fixable.</li>
            </ol>
            
            
            <p class="margin"> 
                    Too thin? Add more pulp to the water.
                    <br>
                    Too thick? Add more water.
                    <br>
            Did you mess up while lifting your deckle? Just put the pulp right back into the container. Mix it up and start over. It's a forgiving craft.
