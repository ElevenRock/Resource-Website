        <p class="center"> Take a minute to look around the room you're in and
            notice how many things are made out of paper.
            There may be books, a few magazines, some printer paper,
            and perhaps a poster on the wall. Yet, if you consider that
            each person in the United States uses 749 pounds of paper 
            every year (adding up to a whopping 187 billion pounds
            per year for the entire population, by far the largest
            per capita consumption rate of paper for any country 
            in the world), then you realize that paper comes in 
            many more forms than meets the eye.

        <h2 class="center"> How Much Paper is in One Tree? </h2>


        <p class="center"> It really all depends on the size of the tree. 
            According to paper manufacturer Boise Cascade, however, 
            a cord of wood (wood stacked 4 feet by 4 feet by 8 feet, 
            or 128 cubic feet) produces nearly 90,000 sheets of paper or
            2,700 copies of a 35-page newspaper!</p>
